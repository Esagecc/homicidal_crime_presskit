        <h1>DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT</h1>
        <p>Homicidal Crimes is a fusion of classic Noir with contemporary drama. My favorite genre, crime drama, is due to the flaw characters that roam in the community and the protagonist who is flaw as well is out to stop them.</p>
        <p>The fictional story was developed to emphasize the deep racial tension that our community deals with from the criminals as well as from the justice system. The detectives in the film demonstrate the types of evidence that they decipher to identify the killer. Their investigation is artistically film to reenact the crime scenes.</p> 
        <p>Some may strike the film as offensive but the characters are portraying what detectives and criminals would say. Strong willed characters are there to challenge each other and push back. When strong topics are presented, it must not be whitewash for all audience.</p>
        <p>The film is very intense to keep the audience on the edge of their seat. I used the best shooting sites of San Antonio. I worked with a great set of actors that delivered my vision of NeoNoir film that I am proud of. </p>
